# Otlob Clone – Java GUI Application

This is a desktop-based food ordering system inspired by the "Otlob" delivery service, developed using Java and GUI components (likely Swing). The system simulates the roles of Admins, Customers, and Sellers, allowing interactions like adding products, managing orders, and placing orders through a graphical interface.

## 💡 Features

- **Multi-role system**: Supports Admin, Customer, and Seller functionalities.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Implemented using Java GUI (likely Swing or AWT).
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses `.bin` files to store data like users, products, and orders.
- **Core Functionalities**:
  - Admin: Manage users and oversee the system.
  - Customer: Browse products, add to cart, and place orders.
  - Seller: Add and manage products.
  - Order tracking and status updates.
